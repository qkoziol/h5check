Instructions for the Installation of H5check Software
=====================================================

========
Build:
========
Assuming gcc, gmake and h5cc are in your $PATH, just do
    % ./configure
    % gmake

To compile with large file support:
    % gmake CFLAGS="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE"

The default compiler and HDF5 library compiler are set to gcc and h5cc.
If you want to use a different C compiler and/or h5cc command, do
    % gmake CC=gcc H5CC=$mypath/h5cc

To set different compiler flags use CFLAGS variable, e.g.
    % env CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
This command will set the compiling to "gcc -O2".

To configure for large file support:
    % env CFLAGS="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE" ./configure

============
Run tests:
============
To run the test suite,
    % gmake check

==========
Install:
==========
To install the tool and the library
    % gmake install

These go to h5check/{bin,lib} of the built directory by default.  If you want
to install it somewhere else like /usr/software/{bin,lib},
    % gmake prefix=/usr/software install
