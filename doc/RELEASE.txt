- The following platforms may produce an h5check executable that is 32bit
  based and is not able to handle HDF5 files larger than 2GB. The following
  instructions show how to configure h5check to handle large file support:

  For Linux:
     % env CFLAGS="-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE" ./configure

  For Solaris:
     % env CC="cc -m64" ./configure
